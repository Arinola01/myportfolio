          <h3>HR Attrition Analysis</h3>
          <p>The goal of this project is to understand the reasons behind employee turnover, identify trends and patterns, and develop strategies to retain talent and enhance organizational performance. 
            This analysis focuses on studying the causes, rates, and impacts of employee attrition (or turnover) to improve HR practices, reduce costs, and build a stronger, more engaged workforce. <br />
                                           
        <p>Key Insights: <br>
          ✪ 16.1% of employees left their jobs. <br>
          ✪ Employees between the ages of 25-35 years were the highest, while employees above 55 years were the lowest.  <br>
          ✪ The majority of the employees were male. <br>
          ✪ The age group 26-35 years left their job the most. <br>
          ✪ Male employees had more attrition than their female counterparts. <br>
          ✪ Attrition was highest among Sales executives, research scientists, and laboratory technicians. <br>
          ✪ Employees who travel rarely have the highest attrition rate, followed by employees who travel frequently. <br>
          ✪ Employees who had no stocks left the company the most.
        </p>

          <p>Recommendations: <br>
          ✪ HR teams can take proactive steps to reduce employee attrition, enhance employee satisfaction, and improve overall retention rates.  <br>
          ✪ Fostering a positive work environment, offering growth opportunities, and maintaining open lines of communication are key strategies for retaining talent <br>
          ✪ Addressing the causes of turnover and implementing targeted retention strategies will help build a more engaged and stable workforce.<br>
          ✪ Organizations should assign travel based on Employee’s business travel interests.<br>
          ✪ Stocks should be awarded as part of sign-on packages when employees join the company.</p>
